Welcome to Dorning Cyber!

This is going to be an on-going blog for my personal and professional development within the field of cyber security, with the aim of creating and sharing posts on my progress with self-learning outside of work, while also sharing interesting cyber news from general life. 

This will include write-ups for any boxes I tackle on Try Hack Me and Hack the Box, my progress learning various programming languages, updates on my virtualised security home lab, and information on important cyber security events in the general world, all interspersed with some bad jokes and memes, so if any of that sounds interesting youâ€™re in the right place!
