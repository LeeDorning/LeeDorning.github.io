A quick update on my recent learning and career events.

Big news! In the past couple of weeks I’ve sat and passed my CREST CPSA exam! This is my first offensive minded security certification, with all of my other certs more geared towards SOC / Engineering content, so I’m super happy to have passed first time. I’ve been really knuckling down on revision for the exam recently, hence why the blog has been pretty quiet, but now that It’s out the way I’m buzzing to get back into working through Hack The Box and getting some more posts put out there. Now that I’ve got the CREST CPSA passed I’ve got one eye firmly on sitting the CREST CRT in the (near?) future, so I think getting a lot of practical hacking practice in with Hack The Box and other tools is going to be super useful, both to learn my TTP’s and to consolidate what I’ve learned from sitting the CPSA.

I’m going to be starting from the very bottom of Hack The Box with the Starting Point Tier 0 boxes up first, mainly just to provide a nice basis to build upon in the future. the starting point boxes are all pretty basic so don’t expect the write-ups to be particularly long, well to begin with anyway, but as we get further along they'll definitely start to pad out!

See you in the next post where we'll tackle Box 1!
