As the welcome note says, this blog is going to be multi-purpose, acting as a place of personal record of my progress in a fairly relaxed style, while also being intended to provide useful information for my fellow cyber security professionals, so we’re going to be keeping things sensible in here.

Most of this blog is going to be based on my self-learning of red-team material, so expect plenty of online hacking practice box write-ups or posts on how I’m getting on learning scripting languages. Since all of this is a learning experience there will be mistakes, both in this blog and my approach to new boxes, but hopefully it’ll provide some entertainment where I do go wrong!

I’m hoping to provide something of use to other professionals too, so I will be sharing posts on current cyber news if anything particularly tasty pops up… think ransomware, APT’s or new vulnerabilities in major products (I’m looking at you Log4J, you absolute nightmare). The plan is to try and get a new post up every week, but we all know life can get in the way, so we’ll see how things go!
