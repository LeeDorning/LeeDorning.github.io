## Welcome to Dorning Cyber!

This is going to be an on-going blog for my personal and professional development within the field of cyber security, with the aim of creating and sharing posts on my progress with self-learning outside of work, while also sharing interesting cyber news from general life. 

This will include write-ups for any boxes I tackle on Try Hack Me and Hack the Box, my progress learning various programming languages, updates on my virtualised security home lab, and information on important cyber security events in the general world, all interspersed with some bad jokes and memes, so if any of that sounds interesting you’re in the right place!

Most of this blog is going to be based on my self-learning of red-team material, so expect plenty of online hacking practice box write-ups or posts on how I’m getting on learning scripting languages. I will also be sharing general cyber-related posts, news, and updates on my virtualised security home lab. Since all of this is a learning experience there will be mistakes, both in this blog and my approach to new boxes, but hopefully it’ll provide some entertainment where I do go wrong!

See you in the next one!
