Who’s that professional looking bloke down there you ask? That is in fact me, your author, this blog’s creator, and a current cyber security engineer. I’m working hard to continue developing in my professional abilities in my free time alongside carrying out my daily work, and hopefully this blog will provide a reference point where that progress can be seen!

### My Career So Far
Cyber security seems to be a field which has very few routes into your first position, with the vast majority of people normally coming from a background in helpdesk or other IT positions, rather than being truly ‘entry-level’. My career has taken a very different trajectory to that of the norm however, and hopefully can provide some hope for those who want to break into this sector.

My career started when I  got placed in a Cyber Security apprenticeship in 2019, working within an internal 3rd Line ICT team to provide a ‘one-man SOC’ function alongside completing the BCS Level 4 Cyber Security Technologist Apprenticeship. I came into that role with next to no experience in IT, let alone cyber security, so it was a steep learning curve at first, but I took every opportunity to learn that I was offered and within 6 months was trusted to single-handedly run our security operations. Over time I helped grow out the SOC team, including bringing in more colleagues, creating policy/process, and deploying new tooling, including: SIEM, EDR, Content Filtering, Threat Hunting, Sandbox, IAM, PAM and Phishing protection.

I have since moved on from this role, and I currently work for one of the top MSSP's in the UK as a Cyber Security Engineer, heading up their managed SOC / SIEM function. I am also involved in the delivery of phishing campaigns, UAT, dark web monitoring, and cyber essentials auditing. I'm looking forward to continue my learning in this role, alongside my study outside of work.

### Certifications
Throughout my career I have studied for and passed a number of industry recognised certifications, both during and after the completion of my apprenticeship. My current certifications include:

- CREST CPSA
- CompTIA CYSA+
- CompTIA Security+
- CompTIA Network+
- Microsoft SC-900
- Microsoft AZ-900
- ISC2 CC
- BCS Level 4 Cyber Security Technologist Apprenticeship

Clearly my strength at the time of writing is in blue-team, with the vast majority of my work and study being based around such, however I have been conducting penetration testing sporadically through my career and red-team is something I find highly interesting. This feeds into what much of my self-learning is geared towards at the moment, including completing boxes on Try Hack Me and Hack The Box and learning to code in Python (amongst others), with the specific purpose of sitting and passing my  CREST CRT to achieve CHECK Team Member status in the coming months and years.

So, there you have it, my story so far in cyber security and the goals I have for my current self-learning. I hope you enjoy your visit and the posts can provide some kind of use, even if it is just a laugh at the memes (there are going to be plenty). And on that note, I’m going to sign off with one of those memes, and I’ll see you in a post coming soon!
